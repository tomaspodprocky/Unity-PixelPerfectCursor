  m_Description:
    m_Untranslated: "This is a small project to test out cursor behaviour in Unity.
      Maily to check how easily the cursor can be changed and made pixel perfect,
      at least from the appeareance side.\n\nFirst thing - in order to make a cursor
      resizable, one cannot use hardware cursor. As soon as hardware cursor is enabled,
      the cursor texture will be matched to the current screen resolution. Even if
      the cursor texture would be resized, there is no change - you can try it by
      unselecting \"Force software\" and try to move the slider.\n\nPlease note:
      project uses Pixel Cursors free package from Unity Asset store.\n \nWith a
      software cursor, it is possible to resize the cursor, even though the cursor
      will no move \"pixel by pixel\" . It will still move using the pixel in the
      used screen resolution.\nBut now the texture can be resized and used accordingly.\nTry
      to set a PPU value (pixels per unit) to see how a cursor will resize (cursor
      texture is 32x32 pixels).\nAlso try to se the target horizontal resolution
      and the cursor should resize accordingly.\n\nNote: if you are using the new
      Input system, for the software cursor to work you must set the \"Active input
      handling\" in the player settings to \"Both\"."
