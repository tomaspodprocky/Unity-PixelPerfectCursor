# Playground

Project in Unity3D to test out different topics, which sporadically come around and may be difficult to remember how to work with them. Also, for first time experimentation to understand the functional implementation in Unity.

## Pixel Perfect cursor

Testing and experimentation with mouse cursors. Changing the cursor graphics, resizing the cursor to make to look "Pixel perfect" and possibly other operations will come as well.
I created this as in regular time I have to dig out information about cursor functionality in Unity3D and almost never things work immediately the first time.

Note: the project uses [Pixel cursors](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/icons/pixel-cursors-109256) package.
