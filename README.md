# Pixel Perfect cursor

A small project in Unity3D to test and experiment with mouse cursors. Changing the cursor graphics, resizing the cursor to make to look "Pixel perfect" and possibly other operations will come as well.
I created this as in regular time I have to dig out information about cursor functionality in Unity3D and almost never things work immediately the first time.

Note: the project uses [Pixel cursors](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/icons/pixel-cursors-109256) package.
